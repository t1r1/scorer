# scorer

### Run:

To run the script:
`node index.js answers.json`

To run the test:
`npm i`
`npm run test`

### Sources:

1. https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/node-js-process-argv-property/ - here I found out how to get arguments from the console input to read a file

### Side notes:

1. I have fixed a typo in JSON for the "repected_by_managers" fields, so both in my code and in the file it is "respected_by_managers".
